F-Groups

DataStructures:
-Associated table to hash each fingerprint

In the table, each key will be a fingerprint; each associated value will be a linked list which stores all names that share that fingerprint

Invariant: Partway through reading lines, all names that share the same fingerprint are contained in the same linked list

Functions:

1. Read in all data, deal with bad input
	-Read in fingerprint, check for bad fingerprint
		-Everything until the first whitespace is the fingerprint
		-First non-whitespace character begins the name and ends at a new line character
	-Add associated name to list at the corresponding table cell
2. Prune and print and delete
	-Loop through table start to finish
		-If cell is Null, skip
		-If list contains one name, delete cell and skip
		-If list contains more than one name print the whole list in specified output
		-Delete cell if not already
3. Clean up memory
	-Delete table structure
