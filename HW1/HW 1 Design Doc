Homework #1 Design Document for Part B

The data structures implemented will be Table and List. The Table's void* key
will always point to a char* of an Atomized fingerprint. The Table's void* value
will always point to a List. Each List in the Table will
contain a list of char*s that represent Atomized names for each fingerprint.

The first invariant is that every fingerprint which has been processed is
already Atomized as a key in the Table. The second invariant is that every
name which has been processed has been added into the List of names paired
with its corresponding fingerprint.

Fingerprint groups are computed by looping through the Table by converting it
to an array, and for each List with a length of at least 2, all names in that
list are printed as a group.
