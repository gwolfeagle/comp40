PART C SOLUTION - What problems can F-groups solve?

The main function of the F-Groups program is taking multiple digests and pairing them with values. Another name for this is a hash.
Possible real applications:
-Testing the strength of cryptographic hash functions, where the list of strings paired with the fingerprint represent strings that will collide when hashed
-Used to find marked files very quickly, especially in large directories and file systems, by assigning to each file a marker that can later be used to group them
-Sorting people based on blood types
-Sorting based on shared characteristics

---------------------------------------------------
Implemented correctly everything except handling fingerprints and names greater than 512 characters in length. All else requires no further work as far as programmers are able to tell.

Approx. Time spent on writing program: 18 hours

Thanks to Ross Schlaikjer for help debugging.
